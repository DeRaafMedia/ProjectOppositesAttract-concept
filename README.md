[ life-death ]

The concept of these pieces are that I take two words that are opposites of each other (life-death, happy-unhappy, war-peace), and use those words as image search terms on Google. From the results I select images that 'attract' me and that I can use without much hassle (size, background easily removable, etc) to make images collages. I was raised up without watching much television and one of the things I spend my time doing was to take magazines and making collages of the pictures found in them.

The search terms found can be combined into one image like the above ([ life-death ]) and below ([ war-peace ]):

[ war-peace ]

Or can be made as two seperate images:

[ happy ]

[ unhappy ]

====================================

My goal for this concept is to find a way to automate the process.
